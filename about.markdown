This is my personal blog, where I write about security, privacy, and related topics. This website uses a self-hosted [Plausible Analytics Community Edition](https://github.com/plausible/community-edition/) instance and does not use Google Analytics. Plausible is a lightweight, privacy-friendly analytics tool that collects only aggregated, anonymous usage data, does not use cookies, does not track users across sites, and does not build personal profiles. Unlike Google Analytics, all data stays under my control and is never shared with third parties.
